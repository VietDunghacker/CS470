# No Sleep Driver
## Using Yolo Model:
The **"UsingYolov4_All_In_One"** folder contains everything about using Yolo to detect drowsiness.

The dataset and trained_weight are too large to upload on github, therefore, I compress them in .zip files and devide them into many parts. For using, just download all the parts and extract them normally.

For source code, I use the Jupyter notebook, you can find this file in the same folder and open it with Google Colab. Any instruction and note are contained inside the notebook file.
